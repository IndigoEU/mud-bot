# Multi-User Dungeon bot for Discord!

You ever wanted to explore a dungeon? Of course you did. Now you have the chance!
Grab your new shiny sword and dive deep into the unknown dank depths of this ever crumbling dungeon festering with vicious monsters!
<hr>
<h2>What is it about?</h2>
The idea is to allow players to walk around a dungeon, running away from ever crumbling ceilings. That means no going back.<br>
During exploration you may encounter bloodthirsty slimes, skeletons of fallen adventurers or even rats wielding frightening shears!<br>
From fallen enemies the party will be able to collect items and <b>wisps</b> - a form of currency used inside of the dungeon - that can 
later be exchanged for better weapons in shops scattered across the dungeon.

<h2>How do you use this bot? (aka - commands)</h2>
<b>/help</b> - get help about commands<br>
<b>/createcharacter</b> - you can have up to 4 characters<br>
<b>/joingame</b> - you join a queue, looking for the game. When at least 4 players are in the queue, the game starts. <br>
<b>/iteminfo [item id]</b> - get all info about a specific item<br>
<b>Once you're in a dungeon:</b><br>
<b>/move [direction]</b> - you vote what direction you want to go. Once majority of players vote, the party goes in specified direction<br>
